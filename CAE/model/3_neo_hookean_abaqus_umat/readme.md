A neo-hookean umat example can be found in abaqus training material and abaqus document.

Using neo-hookean UMAT to solve plane strain 2D block compress problem.

Result can convergence.

t=0.91 (strain almost at 46%) the system generate negative eigenvalue. 

Stress and esigenvalue result is same with the abaqus build in material neo hookean model.
