A most simple umat example.

A linear elastic umat example can be found in abaqus training material and abaqus document.

Using linear elastic UMAT to solve plane strain 2D block compress problem.

Result can convergence.

Question:

At t=0.91 (strain almost at 46%) the system generate negative eigenvalue. 
(1)Why the linear elastic material can have negative eigenvalue? Can be predicted theoretically?
The negative eigenvalue generate because of structure instablity?

(2)The stress result is same with hyper elastic model. Is that ture?
